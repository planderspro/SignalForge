# GitHub Actions Workflow Fixes - Completed

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ ESLint TypeScript Configuration
- **Fixed**: ESLint was ignoring all TypeScript files
- **Changes**: 
  - Removed TypeScript file ignores from `.eslintrc.cjs`
  - Added TypeScript parser and plugins
  - Updated lint script to include `.ts,.tsx` extensions
  - Updated dependencies to compatible versions

### 2. ✅ Package.json Scripts
- **Fixed**: Lint script only processed JS files
- **Changes**: Updated `--ext js,jsx` to `--ext js,jsx,ts,tsx`

### 3. ✅ CI Workflow Issues
- **Fixed**: Non-existent `test:integration` script
- **Changes**: Replaced with `test:e2e` Playwright tests

### 4. ✅ Deprecated GitHub Actions
- **Fixed**: Updated deprecated `actions/create-release@v1` and `actions/upload-release-asset@v1`
- **Changes**: Replaced with `actions/github-script@v7` for modern release creation

### 5. ✅ Test Configuration
- **Fixed**: Added proper Vitest and Playwright configurations
- **Changes**: 
  - Created `playwright.config.ts`
  - Updated `vite.config.ts` with test settings
  - Added coverage reporting with v8
  - Created basic unit and E2E test examples

### 6. ✅ Dependencies
- **Added**: Missing dependencies for complete testing and linting
- **Dependencies**: `jsdom`, `@vitest/coverage-v8`, updated ESLint packages

## Validation Results

✅ **ESLint**: `npm run lint` - Passes without errors
✅ **TypeScript**: `npm run typecheck` - No type errors  
✅ **Unit Tests**: `npm run test:unit` - 2 tests passing
✅ **Coverage**: `npm run test:coverage` - Coverage reporting works
✅ **Build**: `npm run build` - Production build successful
✅ **E2E Config**: Playwright configuration created

## Files Modified

1. `.eslintrc.cjs` - Fixed TypeScript support
2. `package.json` - Updated scripts and dependencies  
3. `vite.config.ts` - Added test configuration
4. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Fixed script references
5. `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Updated deprecated actions
6. `playwright.config.ts` - Created E2E test configuration
7. `src/utils/math.test.ts` - Created sample unit test
8. `tests/e2e/basic.spec.ts` - Created sample E2E test

## Next Steps

The CI/CD workflows should now run successfully. All major issues have been resolved:
- TypeScript files are properly linted
- Tests run in isolation (unit vs E2E)
- Coverage reporting is configured
- Modern GitHub Actions are used
- Build process works correctly
